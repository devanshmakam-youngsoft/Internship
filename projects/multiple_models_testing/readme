➕ How to Add a New Model

This project uses a plugin-based model registry.
Each model is registered once and can be selected via .env.

1️⃣ Create a model file

Create a new Python file inside the models/ folder.

Example:

models/my_model.py

2️⃣ Implement the model class

Your model must:

Inherit from BaseModel

Implement load() and generate()

NOT load heavy resources at import time

from core.base_model import BaseModel

class MyModel(BaseModel):
    def load(self):
        # Load weights or connect to API here
        print("MyModel loaded")

    def generate(self, prompt: str) -> str:
        return f"Response: {prompt}"

3️⃣ Register the model (MANDATORY)

Open models/__init__.py and register the model once.

from core.registry import register_model
from models.my_model import MyModel

register_model("my-model", MyModel)


⚠️ If you skip this step, the model will NOT be available.

4️⃣ Select the model via .env

Set the model name in your .env file:

MODEL_USE=my-model

5️⃣ Run the application

From the project root:

python -m app.main


The model defined in .env will be loaded and used.

✅ Checklist

 File created inside models/

 Inherits BaseModel

 Implements load() and generate()

 Registered in models/__init__.py

 MODEL_USE set correctly in .env

Done ✅

ℹ️ Notes

Models are not loaded at startup

Only the selected model’s load() method is executed

Registration stores class references, not instances
